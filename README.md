# Kurator
While rider ratings enable to get immediate feedback from the rider about the ride, it is far from scientific and needs to be considered only as a ballpark.  For instance a regular on-demand car pool rider might simply press five stars out of habit and might be displeased with the service, in the past few days due to a combination of factors: long ride times, long wait times, higher fares and badly rated drivers.  Kurator is a mathematical model that aims to accurately predict the internal satisfaction of a prospective car ride and enables ride sharing companies to manage the overall satisfaction of the rider by providing alternatives before allocation.
